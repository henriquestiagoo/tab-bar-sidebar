I am an **iOS Software Engineer** that have been working with Apple platforms since 2018.\n\nThe newsletter features the best articles, news, tips and apps submitted by **iOS** developers worldwide. My mission is to showcase the work of **iOS** devs by providing a platform for them to share their work. Every **week**, I will provide you with a list of high valuable **resources** submitted by the community. Everyone is welcome to submit articles or apps for free consideration. To submit content, users will be prompted to log in and access their dashboard.\n\nI will **review** and **evaluate** each **submission** and decide what shall be published each week. I may opt to find another way to decide what will be published in the future. In the meantime, feel free to reach me out with suggestions!\n\nMy goal is to create a platform **100%** fed by the iOS community ðŸ’›.\n\n**Subscribe** if you would like to stay up to date and receive emails when new content is published!\n\nI hope you like it.\n\n~Tiago, iOS Coffee Break."
